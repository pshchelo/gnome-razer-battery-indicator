# TODO

## MvP (usable for myself) - single device, hardcoded options
- run a periodic task in a loop
- call the python script and parse results
- set the indicator to be a composite of icon and text
- change text based on percentage
- properly react to device (dis|re)connects

## alpha
- change icon based on percentage/charging status
- show device name and more info in the menu
- more complex icon based on device type (type + battery? only type?)

## Beta (usable for others)
- support several devices at once
  - list devices and battery status in the menu
- support customizations
  - polling interval
  - choose which device battery status to show in the main icon
