# TODO

## alpha
- properly react to device (dis|re)connects
  - openrazer does not seem to react too well,
    it remembers the device and returns battery level of 0 for disconnected devices it remembers
- change icon based on percentage/charging status
- show device name and more info in the menu
- more complex icon based on device type (type + battery? only type?)

## Beta (usable for others)
- support several devices at once
  - list devices and battery status in the menu
- support customizations
  - polling interval
  - choose which device battery status to show in the main icon?
    - show the least charged (and non-charging?) device?
